          At Care Cards Collective, we strive to balance care, creativity, and
          fairness for every customer. This Care Balance Policy explains how we
          approach creative satisfaction, revisions, and service boundaries.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Creative services are inherently subjective. While we aim to deliver
          thoughtful and meaningful cards, emotional interpretation may vary
          between individuals.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">2. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
          AI-generated poems and designs are created based on the information
          you provide. Results may vary in tone or interpretation and are
          delivered as-is unless upgraded with Human Touch.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Human Touch Refinement</h2>
        <p>
          Human Touch includes one thoughtful refinement pass performed by a
          Care Cards poet. It does not include unlimited revisions or complete
          rewrites unless stated otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">4. Priority Service</h2>
        <p>
          Priority service expedites delivery time but does not alter the
          creative nature of the service or guarantee subjective satisfaction.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Revisions & Adjustments</h2>
        <p>
          We will correct factual errors or misunderstandings. Requests based
          solely on personal preference may not qualify for additional
          revisions.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Refunds & Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the personalized nature of our services, completed digital
          services are generally non-refundable. We encourage contacting
          support to seek fair resolution if an issue arises.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. Respectful Use</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to refuse service for content that is abusive,
          discriminatory, unlawful, or misrepresentative.
        </p>
